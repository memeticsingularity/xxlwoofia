"Duncan Charles. Don't fret, I'm not here on an investigation."

Type: Fire

Role: Support

Traits: Sniper Triple Strike / Power Boost

---
During his school years, Duncan Charles was deeply influenced by the senior detectives around him.
Growing up surrounded by their work, he developed a strong admiration for the profession. Driven by
a strong sense of justice, he trained in magic with the goal of joining the Magical Regulation
Bureau. However, his efforts never translated into results. His magical ability remained near the
bottom of his class. In order to pass the licensing exam, he made a bold choice. He began studying
firearms, tools often looked down upon by traditional wizards, and devoted himself to the
underexplored field of generative magic, attempting to combine the two. This unconventional pursuit
unexpectedly opened a new path for him. Duncan set a new record by becoming the first student
admitted with the lowest score. His acceptance made him both controversial and highly talked-about
among his peers.

His mind is constantly racing with ways to raise more funds for the council, coming up with
clever—and sometimes mischievous—ideas. Anything on campus could potentially be turned into a new,
highly profitable venture by him.

Because he is far stricter than Kantos when it comes to approving student budget applications, some
jokingly call him the Walking Student Council Cashflow System.

words always manage to warm those around him unknowingly. He also has a strong sense of justice that
rivals that of Choi Yuhyun. However, despite appearing perfect, he has a bad habit of doing
everything with his feet instead of his hands. He is so good with his feet that he has trouble
switching back to using his hands.

since the Netherworld is always dim and dark, this essentially means he works nearly 24 hours a day,

future.

I'll follow your command."

In private, Orem actually has a playful and open side, much more easygoing than he appears to be
while on duty. He enjoys games that most people don't find interesting, such as ring toss, goldfish
scooping, bumper cars at night markets, and so on. He also seems to like outdoor sports like
basketball, giving off a surprisingly energetic vibe.

However, because he's very strict about keeping work and personal life separate, whenever he returns
to the navy after taking some time off, it always takes him a bit of time to adjust his playful
mindset back to professional mode.

The Proud Shark, full speed—!"

Role: Fighter

Traits: Low HP Follow-Up Damage

Capt. Locke's personality is just as wild as he appears. He is not the type of disciplined captain
that only follows the rules. To be blunt, he can even be described as a bit chaotic. It's not
uncommon to see him causing a ruckus on social media with some bizarre incident he caused in the
Draconic Depths.

Although he may not realize it himself, his unruly and carefree personality seems to make him quite
popular among his crew, quite a unique charm exclusive to Captain Locke.
